</br>

### Data source:

    Provided data:
    weather.csv: Data was partially extracted from the Bureau of Metreorology website daily between Nov.2022 and Apr.2023 for the city of Melbourne
    price_and_demand.csv: contains energy price and demand figures for the state of Victoria at a half an hour interval between Nov.2022 and Apr.2023. Data was extracted from the Australian Energy Market Operator

### Tools and Library Used:
    Jupyter Notebook
    Pandas
    Sklearn
    Matplotlib
